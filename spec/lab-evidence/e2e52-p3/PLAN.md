# E2E-52/P3 — LOAN2 progressive closure: campaign plan + subround P3-1 (bare PAGE)

Committed BEFORE any `ocaml/` byte of this round (PROTOCOL #1). Baseline: HEAD
`6c44d8d` (P2 close, g276 attested), compiler binary `85bf7a26…` (built rc=0 this
session, identical to the P2 registration gate), tree clean except the operator's
`handoff.config.json`. Historical baseline re-verified where cheap; full gate actuals
recorded below before promotion.

## Campaign objective

Compile `artefacts/LOAN2.PLI` (sha `7be23ba3…`, UNMODIFIED throughout) toward a
whole-file byte-identical `.REL` against `golden/first/LOAN2/LOAN2.REL` (sha
`712cfcb2…`, never re-derived). Loop per blocker: smallest reproducible construct →
search existing goldens/claims/probes → bounded oracle experiment only if evidence is
insufficient → smallest defensible fix → probe byte parity → focused regressions →
recompile LOAN2 → record advance. No special-casing of LOAN2; no invented boundaries.

## Subround P3-1 — PUT FILE with a bare PAGE control item

### 1. Measured blocker (reproduced verbatim, rc captured directly)

`pli80c artefacts/LOAN2.PLI` → rc=2,
`codegen: PUT FILE with a bare PAGE control item [TBD] (line 99) -- PAGE has DR's bytes
(E46N10, 0023-0034, CALL ?PAGOP after the attach) but no specimen of MINE, and LINE is
refused by DR itself (E46N21); SKIP is lowered`.

CLASSIFICATION: **my-gap** — DR ACCEPTS the shape (E46N10 golden; `spec/INVENTORY.txt`
E46N10 row, [E2E-42/P2c]). No new oracle call is needed: the DR side is measured.

ROOT CAUSE of why the message names 99 and not 54: the raise comes from the E2E-52/P1
LEXICAL PRESCAN (`prescan_stmt` → `match_put_list_lit` → `bare_ctl_put`), which walks
EVERY Sput before any lowering; LOAN2's `open ... print [pagesize(0)]` at 54/56 are
separate `open_mode_word` refusals (verified live on a scratch CRLF probe: `OPEN option
PRINT is outside what this compiler lowers`), currently masked behind the prescan stop.

### 2. The DR bytes (read out of the object, PROTOCOL #6 — `tools/reldump.py` on `golden/e42p2c/E46N10/E46N10.REL`, 384 bytes, CODE 0x3E=62, DATA 0x0A=10)

Statement at 0023-0034 (18 bytes):

    0023 21 <RELOC common 0x0000>          LXI H,*C(OUTF)
    0026 11 52 06                          LXI D,0652
    0029 01 <word 002A-002B>               LXI B,*CODE  (backpatched: LINK-SET-LC code
                                            002A + RELOC code 0x0035 -- continuation =
                                            the CLOSE statement at 0035)
    002C CD 0000  LINK-CHAIN-EXT code 002D ?SIOOP
    002F CD 0000  LINK-CHAIN-EXT code 0030 ?PAGOP       <- the PAGE, NO count operand, NO MVI
    0032 CD 0000  LINK-CHAIN-EXT code 0033 ?QIOOP

Corpus corroboration: COPYLPT:53 `put file(printfile) page;` = the same 18 bytes behind
a PRINT open (0215-0226; `predict_p2c.py` self-test span `COPYLPT:53 = 18`). E46N1
(bare SKIP, byte-exact panel specimen) is 20 bytes — PAGE differs from SKIP exactly by
`MVI A,01` being ABSENT and `?SKPOP` being replaced by `?PAGOP` (E46N1 CODE 64 vs E46N10
CODE 62). This is why PAGE is a distinct control KIND, not an encoded skip.

### 3. Boundaries KEPT (no witness → refusal by name; none of these is licensed by E46N10)

- `PAGE(n)` / `PAGE(expr)` on a file PUT: unmeasured (manual shows `PAGE[(p)]`, no
  object carries a count) — stays refused as `the control item PAGE with a count` via
  the ordinary `file_items` item message; the **E46N21 marker substring** `control item
  LINE with a count, unmeasured on the named-file route [TBD] (line 12)` stays alive.
- PAGE + items on a file PUT (`put file(f) page list('A')`): unmeasured; refuses BY NAME.
- Non-leading PAGE: unmeasured position (same positional law as [C304]); refuses.
- CONSOLE `put page`: unmeasured (N3_PAGE negative panel row, marker `PUT form`, my-gap
  per golden/negpanel1/NG25); the file fix must NOT route console PAGE anywhere.
- The routing invariant [C300]: a PUT naming a file never falls through to the console
  helper; the `file_out` guard of the `Pfile` arm is unchanged (E46N10 opens with the
  lowered `stream output title(<literal>)`).

### 4. Predictions (before any compiler byte)

P1. `pli80c probes/E46N10.PLI` whole-file `cmp` vs the golden: **rc=0, 384 bytes,
    byte-exact FIRST TRY** (mine sha == golden `e…` sha recorded after the fact).
    CODE 62, DATA 10. Bytes/relocs exactly §2 above; ?PAGOP appears in my LINK stream
    for the first time as a LINK-CHAIN-EXT at 0030, name-only, no push.
P2. Regression zero-drift: E46N1..N9, N11..N19 whole-file cmp each rc=0 unchanged;
    full gate 1196/0 before registration; negative panel 181/181 INCLUDING N3_PAGE and
    E46N21 with the pinned markers; divergence 9/9; coverage 139 rows 0/0; prose 5.
P3. Census: COPYLPT's refusal MOVES off the PAGE message (its PAGE now lowers; expected
    next COPYLPT stop is its OPEN-attribute/ENVIRONMENT surface or a later unlowered
    construct — record the ACTUAL message); LOAN2's refusal moves PAST line 99 —
    predicted DIRECTION: next stop at/after the OPEN PRINT lines 54/56 (a `OPEN option
    PRINT is outside` class refusal) unless the prescan hits another unlowered construct
    earlier; record ACTUAL verbatim, do not fix it this subround. LOAN2 is NEVER claimed
    exact.
P4. Registration: SPECIMENS +1 (E46N10), REJECTS −1, `--update-inventory` 1196→1197
    (diff exactly ONE line flips from refusal to specimen), post-reg gate rc=0 1197/0.

### 5. Progress table (cumulative index; detail lives in claims/RESULTS)

| Subround | Initial blocker | Evidence | Compiler change | Exact specimens | LOAN2 outcome |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P3-1 | `PUT FILE bare PAGE [TBD] (line 99)` | E46N10 golden + COPYLPT:53 (existing [E2E-42/P2c]) | codegen: `Sk_page` kind + ?PAGOP on the file route (arm owed) | E46N10 (owed) | owed past 99 |
