# PROGRESS.md — DRPLi

Manual prose wins over the managed block below it. Do not hand-edit the managed block.
This file tracks *working state*; compiler behaviour itself belongs to `spec/CLAIMS.md`.

## Current phase — E2E-49/P2 CLOSED (FULL compile-tier gate rc=0 measured at HEAD `d5983e8`, recorded `8926b83`; CLOSE prose + archive in the commit that carries this text)

- Round (OPERATOR-authorized 2026-11-01): member-vs-member FIXED CHARACTER compares in
  TEST. Pre-registration `3bd9417` committed BEFORE any oracle call (probes E49B1..B5,
  HYPOTHESES, BASELINE-MINE at `7fa763b`: baseline refused all five rc=2 — every gap
  `my-gap`, NO dr-refuses); fill-in `586c240`; ONE oracle run 5 ok / 5; goldens +
  `spec/lab-evidence/e2e49-p2/RESULTS.md` `62f5622`; docs `1416f52`.
- Arm 1 `b1e9221` (codegen only, committed ALONE): `op_mov_a_b = 0x78`; encoder
  `str_cmp_shape_fix_mm` matching the QUALIFIED pair `ImemF/ImemF` ONLY; stacked head as
  ONE bundled thunk in written order; collapse `06 capl / 78` iff `capl = capr` else
  `3E capr`; `?SCCCM`; C2/CA + [C309] fill; NO prescan change. ACTUALS on that tree:
  five goldens whole-file BYTE-EXACT; E48/E49 sweep 61/61; registered panel 1131/1131;
  out-of-scope refusals rc=2; collapse verified NOT to leak into the literal template.
- Step 6: part 1 `0abf1c1` (claims C337..C341 from RESULTS §2 ONLY; SPECIMENS E49B1..B5;
  sanctioned `--update-inventory` 5 rows → panel **1136**; census re-snapshot counts
  UNCHANGED 15/0/26/0); part 2a `8c1d2ee` (3 new COVERAGE rows); part 2b `d5983e8`
  (widening of `COND.CMP_LENGTHS_POSITIONAL` to EXACT:8 + three labelled SUPERSEDED
  clauses — PROTOCOL #2, originals verbatim).
- FULL gate at `d5983e8` rc=0, ACTUALS as printed: byte panel **1136 byte-exact / 0 fail
  of 1136**, negative **181/181** (E46K14 `[dr-refuses]`, marker UNMOVED), divergence
  **9/9**, coverage **125 rows, 0 errors, 0 warnings**, census **15/0/26/0**, prose
  **5 active files clean**. `dune build` rc=0. BYTE TIER ONLY — no `spec/RUNTIME.txt` row
  came or comes from this round.
- Laws: [C337] stacked-cell parking in the member-vs-member `?SCCCM` head (per-shape
  mechanism; `EB` only vs pooled literals); [C338] equal-extent collapse `06 n/78`,
  member-vs-member ONLY — literal template keeps two immediates (equal-length literal
  case [TBD]); [C339] positional lengths on an all-member pair; [C340] written side
  selects the `*D` slot; [C341] head size follows the length pair, member pair pools no
  literal (DATA 000C, [C314]).
- Keep refusing (RESULTS §3): ANY BARE spelling in a member pair; the equal-extent
  collapse for member-vs-literal; STORE; literal-vs-literal; BASED; fixed truthiness;
  over-extent; relations beyond `=`/`^=`; `^( )`.
- NEXT: NO active round — a successor session without an operator instruction confirms
  HEAD and tree, runs `/handoff verify`, records state and STOPS; candidate pool in
  `HANDOFF.md` → Next action. Superseded prose (this round's IN FLIGHT sections AND the
  surviving P1 closing-era sections AND the stale P1-era stubs/evidence/Blockers) is
  archived verbatim in `docs/history/2026-11-01-e49p2-closed.md`. No push; operator
  `handoff.config.json` edit stays unstaged.

## Next action

The ONE active spec lives in `HANDOFF.md` → its single level-2 Next-action heading: the
E2E-49/P2 round is CLOSED, a successor session awaits the OPERATOR's named round, records
state and stops. No competing action exists anywhere else; PROGRESS does not restate it
(PROTOCOL: handoff docs point at claims/specs, never duplicate authority).

## Verified milestones (provenance: `docs/history/README.md`; evidence: `spec/lab-evidence/`)

- E2E-48/P1 — 24/24 probes byte-identical + registered, claims C309–C316, gate 1098/0: `992ccad`.
- E2E-48/P2c CLOSED — arms `14c7321`…`e21281a` era, RETIRE promotions, claims C317–C320,

- E2E-48/P2e round 5 — pre-registration `421656a` committed BEFORE the oracle; one run
  7 ok / 8 (E48E6 `BIT REQ` = dr-refuses; P-E6 MISS kept in RESULTS §1); goldens + RESULTS
  `e2b77ba`; lowering arms 1–3 `d18c6ab`/`bab0d16`/`e49902a` (arm-3 spec archived in
  `docs/history/2026-10-31-p2e-arm3-closed.md`).
- E2E-48/P2e CLOSED — arm 4 `046046a`, arm 5 `c215ea0`, step 6 `809af8d`+`0e64c8b`, docs
  `0749fa6`; claims C327–C332, inventory 1127, coverage 118 rows 0 errors; FULL compile-tier
  GATE rc=0 ACTUAL 1127/0 (neg 181/181, div 9/9, census 15/0/26/0, prose clean) measured at
  `0749fa6` 2026-10-31; closing prose archived in `docs/history/2026-10-31-p2e-closed.md`.
- E2E-49/P1 CLOSED — operand-inverted FIXED compares (member LEFT of literal): pre-registration
  `9b3d860` before the oracle; run 4 ok/4; arms `fee935e`/`b044b7c`; claims C333–C336 + labelled
  C330 CORRECTION; registration panel 1131, coverage 122 rows; FULL GATE rc=0 1131/0 (neg 181/181,
  div 9/9, cov 122/0/0, census 15/0/26/0, prose clean) measured at `0a8ceff`; archive
  `docs/history/2026-11-01-e49p1-closed.md`.
- E2E-49/P2 CLOSED — member-vs-member FIXED TEST compares: pre-registration `3bd9417` before the
  oracle; run 5 ok/5; arm 1 `b1e9221` (stacked parking + equal-extent collapse); claims C337–C341;
  registration panel 1136, coverage 125 rows 0 errors (`0abf1c1`/`8c1d2ee`/`d5983e8`); FULL GATE
  rc=0 **1136/0** (neg 181/181, div 9/9, cov 125/0/0, census 15/0/26/0, prose clean) measured at
  `d5983e8`; archive `docs/history/2026-11-01-e49p2-closed.md`.

## Completed

*Scientific — recorded, not re-run by this session:*
- `PUT FILE … SKIP` behaviour measured on DR and lowered byte-exactly: `E46N11`–`E46N22`
  bank, 18 specimens added → **1074 byte-exact / 0 fail** recorded in
  `spec/lab-evidence/e2e42-p2c/RESULTS.md` §8; runtime panel 71/71 as recorded.
- Gate tiering + `--link-run` able to fail; slow CP/M arms delegated to the external
  `rune-ci` builders (`GATE-TIERS.md`, `spec/notes/rune-ci-external-gate.md`).
- The `timeout-or-hang` collapse in `oracle/run.py`/`linkrun.py` re-measured by exit code:
  51 timeouts, 2 emulator deaths (`PD7`, `PD9`), 2 that do terminate (`RFACT`, `V5`) —
  `[C308]`, and the `HANG_ARMS` / `NO_RUN_ARMS` / `NO_LINK_ARMS` split in `tools/e2e_gate.py`.

*Infrastructure — performed and verified by this session (see `HANDOFF.md` for the boundary):*
- `.gitignore`: appended only the `# Pi Handoff runtime state` / `.pi-guard/` rule; all
  pre-existing oracle/golden/build/thirdparty rules verified still matching.
- Extension installed at `.pi/extensions/context-guard/{index,core,config,checkpoint,renewal}.ts`,
  taken from the pinned Git revision (bytes verified by SHA-256 and blob id against
  `v0.1.0-dev.1` / `2ea6219`); nothing else from the source repo was copied.
- Skill installed at `.agents/skills/pi-handoff/{SKILL.md,references/bootstrap.md,references/commands.md}`.
- `handoff.config.json` written: `readOnly: true` during validation, `enforceClosing: false`,
  `autoCheckpointAtHandoffLevel: false`, renewal disabled, `generationReserve: 20000`
  (initial policy value, not yet tuned).
- Durable files created: `AGENTS.md`, `GOAL.md`, `PROTOCOL.md`, `HANDOFF.md`, `PROGRESS.md`,
  `LEARNINGS.md`.
- **Phase D (read-only) passed in the real Pi runtime**: extension loaded with no import/TS
  errors; `/guard status` reported read-only mode + the real model/window/reserve; `/handoff
  verify` reported `missing` without writing; `/handoff ready check` evaluated without
  attesting; `/guard simulate 30000` → level 1, `/guard simulate 10000` → level 3 with **no**
  checkpoint written; `/handoff` reported a dry run; no `.pi-guard/` directory was created; every
  tracked file hash, the ignored-file count (471 102) and the profile settings were unchanged.
- **Phase E (writable) passed**: `/handoff` → `g1-01ad31c23339`, generation 1,
  content-delta `initial`, freshness `current`; `/handoff ready check` → READY with four blocking
  PASSes; `/handoff ready` → attested; both blocks shared one transactional identity.
  A level-3 automatic checkpoint (`checkpoint-kind: auto`) then preserved a substantive
  "Last verified state" line and a "Guard notes" block **verbatim**, leaving all manual prose
  outside the managed blocks byte-identical, and left `GOAL.md`/`LEARNINGS.md` untouched.


## Pending
- **LOAN2's new prescan my-gap** (`variable i declared with conflicting kinds; decimal pool prescan
  needs one unambiguous type map [TBD]`): measured cause, fix NOT attempted. `codegen.ml:12460-12490`
  builds ONE global `pd_vars` name -> vkind map for the DEC-pool prescan, and LOAN2 declares `i`
  `fixed decimal(4,2)` at line 32 and `fixed bin` at line 211 — two scopes, both legal, DR accepts
  (its golden exists). Making the prescan scope-aware touches ~15 `List.assoc_opt … cx.pd_vars`
  call sites whose prescan deliberately runs WITHOUT statement context, so it is a design change,
  not an arm. It needs its own measured plan; do not start it on faith.
- CREATE remains NOT byte-exact; its measured blocker is still the front-end `%include` gap
  (`pli80c.ml` never expands INCLUDE). Do NOT implement any unmeasured shape from the
  [TBD] list in RESULTS section 3.
- **Renewal chain:** the E2E-48 phase chain closed at its configured cap; its state file is
  archived under `.pi-guard/archives/` and a new session starts a fresh count per
  `handoff.config.json` — the config and `/guard status` are authoritative for enablement,
  autoRenew and cap; this file quotes no numbers.
- **Deferred documentation work (recorded, operator-aware):** `README.md` "Current status
  (rolling)" is stale (ends at E2E-1/C067); it was deliberately NOT touched by the Mission-1
  documentation consolidation. Never use it for status — the ledger and this file are authority.

## Verified evidence

Measured by THIS session (2026-11-01), not quoted from a report: `dune build` rc=0 on this
tree; the FULL compile-tier gate rc=0 at HEAD `d5983e8` with the ACTUALS recorded in
Current phase (byte panel 1136 byte-exact / 0 fail of 1136 incl. all five E49B specimens
whole-file at 256 bytes; negative 181/181 with the E46K14 `[dr-refuses]` pinned marker
UNMOVED; divergence 9/9; coverage 125 rows 0 errors 0 warnings; census EXACT 15 / DIFFERS
0 / REFUSED 26 / UNEXPECTED 0; prose 5 active files clean); `coverage_check.py` rc=0 and
`file_prose_check.py` rc=0 on the close tree. Per-arm ACTUALS (whole-file `cmp` at
`b1e9221`, sweeps 61/61 and 1131/1131, out-of-scope refusals rc=2) stand in git log and
dated `LEARNINGS.md` sections. Round evidence: `golden/e49p2/`,
`spec/lab-evidence/e2e49-p2/{RESULTS,HYPOTHESES,BASELINE-MINE}`; earlier rounds
`spec/lab-evidence/e2e49-p1/` and `spec/lab-evidence/e2e48-*/`; closed-round records:
`docs/history/`.

next-action: — E2E-49/P2 CLOSED; await the OPERATOR's named round

1. Candidate pool (each item needs its OWN pre-registered round — hypotheses committed
   BEFORE any oracle call, PROTOCOL). From `spec/lab-evidence/e2e49-p2/RESULTS.md` §3:
   any BARE spelling in a member-vs-member pair (bare-bare, bare-qualified,
   qualified-bare); the equal-extent collapse for member-vs-LITERAL (`char(3)` against a
   3-char literal in TEST — one probe settles [C338]'s [TBD]); `?SCCCM` in a STORE
   (either orientation) and any fixed-member store value; literal-vs-literal fixed
   compares; BASED members in conditions; the truthiness of a FIXED member; over-extent
   member pairs; relations beyond `=`/`^=`; `^( ... )` composition. Still open from
   `spec/lab-evidence/e2e49-p1/RESULTS.md` §3 and `spec/lab-evidence/e2e48-p2e/RESULTS.md`
   §3: a BARE fixed member on the RIGHT of a literal (P1 asymmetry), over-extent
   literal-LEFT and over-extent INITIAL/STORE, `^=` over a ladder, bare `-0` spelling,
   runtime length rewrite, empty-varying PUT output, `BIT REQ` acceptance elsewhere, PUT
   EDIT of a bit item. The P1 §3 entry "member-vs-member" is MEASURED now ([C337]) and
   leaves the pool. Separate recorded debts, NOT arms: CREATE's `%include` front-end gap
   and LOAN2's scope-aware prescan (PROGRESS → Pending).
2. A successor session WITHOUT an operator instruction: confirm HEAD and tree
   (`git rev-parse HEAD && git status --porcelain=v1`), verify checkpoint freshness
   (`/handoff verify`), and STOP — record state, do not invent work.
3. Standing: goldens untouched except newly added round goldens; §3 shapes NOT
   implemented (missing evidence is the limit, never a licence to guess); probes ≤71 cols
   CRLF+`^Z`; `eval $(opam env)` before dune; never name a probe variable `c`; no push;
   never stage/commit/revert the operator's `handoff.config.json` edit; renewal values
   live ONLY in `handoff.config.json` / `/guard status`; NO `spec/RUNTIME.txt` row may
   come from the compare families until a runtime round measures them.

## Blockers

- Nothing is half-edited at this boundary; every item below is recorded evidence, not a
  guess.
- **Missing evidence is the limit, never a licence to guess** (`PROTOCOL.md` #4). The
  E2E-49/P2 RESULTS §3 shapes (with the surviving P1 §3 and P2e §3 entries) stay named
  refusals until a pre-registered round measures them: ANY BARE spelling in a
  member-vs-member pair, the equal-extent collapse for member-vs-LITERAL ([C338] scope
  warning), FIXED member in a STORE (either orientation), literal-vs-literal fixed, BASED
  member in a condition, fixed-member truthiness, BARE fixed member on the RIGHT,
  over-extent in every orientation incl. INITIAL/STORE, relations beyond `=`/`^=`, `^=`
  over a ladder, `^(string compare)`, bare `-0` spelling, runtime length rewrite,
  empty-varying PUT output, PUT EDIT of a bit item. `member-vs-member` itself is NO
  LONGER on this list — E49B1..B5 measured it ([C337]); the P1-era wording is preserved
  verbatim in `docs/history/2026-11-01-e49p2-closed.md`. No `spec/RUNTIME.txt` row may
  come from these families.
- CREATE is NOT byte-exact; measured front-end blocker: `pli80c.ml` never expands
  `%include` (proposal in `LEARNINGS.md` is `proposed, unverified` — needs its own
  pre-registered round).
- LOAN2's `conflicting kinds` prescan my-gap is a design change, not an arm (see Pending).
